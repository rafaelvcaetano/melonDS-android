# Requirements
In order to play games through melonDS, you need to set the ROM directory for your games and you need the BIOS/firmware files from an original DS or DS Lite. 

If you are unable to play games because they keep crashing when loading, make sure you have the appropriate DS and/or DSi BIOS/firmware files being loaded. You can set the directories for them under Settings > System > Custom BIOS and Firmware > DS BIOS directory / DSi BIOS directory.

# What is working
*  Device scanning for ROMS
*  Games can boot and run
*  Sound
*  Input
*  Mic input
*  Game saves
*  Save states
*  Rewind
*  AR cheats
*  GBA ROM support
*  DSi support (experimental)
*  Controller support
*  Customizable layouts
*  Settings

# What is missing
*  Wi-Fi
*  OpenGL renderer
*  Customizable button skins
*  More display filters

# Performance
Performance is solid on 64 bit devices with thread rendering and JIT enabled, and should run at full speed on flagship devices. Performance on older devices, specially
32 bit devices, is very poor due to the lack of JIT support.

# Integration with third party frontends
It's possible to launch melonDS from third part frontends. For that, you simply need to call the emulation activity with the absolute path to the ROM file. The parameters are the following:
*  Package name: `me.magnum.melonds`
*  Activity name: `me.magnum.melonds.ui.emulator.EmulatorActivity`
*  Parameters:
    * `PATH` - a string with the absolute path to the NDS ROM (ZIP files are supported)

# Building
To build the project you will need Android SDK, NDK and CMake.

## Build steps:
1.  Clone the project, including submodules with:
    
    `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rafaelvcaetano/melonDS-android.git`
2.  Install the Android SDK, NDK and CMake
3.  Build with:
    1.  Unix: `./gradlew :app:assembleGitHubRelease`
    2.  Windows: `gradlew.bat :app:assembleGitHubRelease`
4.  The generated APK can be found at `app/gitHub/release`
